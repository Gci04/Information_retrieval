    "Have you ever googled someone's name without knowing exactly how should it be written? Were you ever reluctant to look up the correct spelling of a query you typed? Or just unable to type properly because of being in a rush? Modern search engines usually do a pretty good job in deciphering defective user input. In order to be able to do that, a good spell-checking mechanism should be incorporated into a search procedure. Today we will take one step further towards building a good search engine and work on tolerant retrieval with respect to user queries. We will consider two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User knows that he doesn't know the correct spelling OR he wants to get the results that follow some known pattern, so he uses so called wildcards - queries like 'retr*val';\n",
    "2. User doesn't know the correct spelling OR he doesn't care OR he's in a rush OR he expects his mistakes will be corrected OR your option, so he makes mistakes and we need to handle them using:\n",

    "We will handle wildcard queries using k-grams. K-grams is a list of consecutive k chars in a string - i.e., for the word *'star'*, it will be '*\\$st*', '*sta*', '*tar*', and '*ar$*', if we take k=3. Take a look at [book](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf) *chapter 3.2.2* to understand how k-grams can help efficiently match a wildcard against dictionary words. Here we will only consider wildcards with star symbols (may be multiple).\n",
    "\n",

    "You need to implement the following:\n",

    "- `build_inverted_index_orig_forms` - creates inverted index of original world forms from `facts` list, which is already given to you.  \n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- `build_k_gram_index` - creates k-gram index which maps every k-gram encountered in facts collection to a list of words containing this k-gram. Use the abovementioned inverted index of original words to construct this index.  \n",
    "    Output format: `'k_gram': ['word1_with_k_gram', 'word2_with_k_gram', ...]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `generate_wildcard_options` - produce a list of vocabulary words matching given wildcard by intersecting postings of k-grams present in the wildcard (refer to *ch 3.2.2*). \n",
